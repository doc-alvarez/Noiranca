Leaders create visions and rhetoric that look admirable on paper, but change very little in reality. We wanted to tackle this differently – sustainability is not a statement, responsibility nor an add-on, and definitely not an option; it is a building block of NOIRANCA.<\/p><p>It is in fact a culture. Instead of designing bags with sustainability elements, we ask ourselves: \"How do we take less from earth with every NOIRANCA bag we make?\"<\/p>",
