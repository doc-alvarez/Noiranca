Traditional synthetic leather is mainly made from plastic-based polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and oil-based polyurethane (PU). In producing these, hazardous toxins that are not fully biodegradable are released into our ecosystem. The material is also easily worn out, usually within 36 months. Some \"vegan leather\" developed from biomaterial are biodegradable and eco-friendly to the environment, yet having sampled most of them, we have found out that none offers the versatility we need in terms of the luxury texture, as well as color options and production scalability.<\/p>",
